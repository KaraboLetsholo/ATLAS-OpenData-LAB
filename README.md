# Isolation Variable
The Isolation variable defined as,
$I = \frac{\sum E_{\nu}}{p_{\mu}}$ will be used as one of the selection criteria on the $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$-dataset. Different values of it are explored and only I = 1 000 000 yields a small uncertaity in the mass of the Z-boson.

# Statistical Significance
The Statistical Significance defined as $S = \frac{N_{S}}{\sigma(N_{B})}$ was computed and found to be approximately 2.45.
